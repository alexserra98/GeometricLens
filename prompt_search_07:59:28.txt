A certain pipelined RISC machine has 8 general-purpose registers R0, R1, . . . , R7 and supports the following operations.
ADD Rs1, Rs2, Rd Add Rs1 to Rs2 and put the sum in Rd
MUL Rs1, Rs2, Rd Multiply Rs1 by Rs2 and put the product in Rd
An operation normally takes one cycle; however, an operation takes two cycles if it produces a result required by the immediately following operation in an operation sequence. Consider the expression AB + ABC + BC, where variables A, B, C are located in registers R0, R1, R2. If the contents of these three registers must not be modified, what is the minimum number of clock cycles required for an operation sequence that computes the value of AB + ABC + BC?
A. 5
B. 6
C. 7
D. 8

Answer: D

Consider a computer design in which multiple processors, each with a private cache memory, share global memory using a single bus. This bus is the critical system resource. Each processor can execute one instruction every 500 nanoseconds as long as memory references are satisfied by its local cache. When a cache miss occurs, the processor is delayed for an additional 2,000 nanoseconds. During half of this additional delay, the bus is dedicated to serving the cache miss. During the other half, the processor cannot continue, but the bus is free to service requests from other processors. On average, each instruction requires 2 memory references. On average, cache misses occur on 1 percent of references. What proportion of the capacity of the bus would a single processor consume, ignoring delays due to competition from other processors?
A. 1/50
B. 1/27
C. 1/25
D. 2/27
