The following are statements about abstract algebra.

In Z_3, the only c for which Z_3[x]/(x^2 + c) is a field is 1.

The statement: “If aH is an element of a factor group, then |aH| divides |a|” is False and the statement “If H and K are subgroups of G then HK is a subgroup of G” is also False.

It's true that every element of a group generates a cyclic subgroup of the group, while it's false that the symmetric group S_10 has 10 elements.

Every function from a finite set onto itself must be one-to-one, and every subgroup of an abelian group is abelian are both true sentences.

The characteristic of the ring 2Z is 0.
