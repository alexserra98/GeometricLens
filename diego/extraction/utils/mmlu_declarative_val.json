        "The following is an excerpt from The Chief Periods of European History by Edward A. Freeman, 1885, British historian and politician:\n\"The Italian nation has been at last united in our own days, and we all rejoiced in its union. Yet we may be allowed to doubt whether the union was not a little too speedy and a little too thorough. It is surely carrying unity too far to wipe out all traces of the independent being, for most purposes to wipe out the very name, of such a land as Sicily. It jars on our feelings to find that, while Ireland at least forms part of the royal style of its sovereign, Sicily is no longer even a geographical expression. The island realm of Roger has sunk to be seven provinces of the kingdom on the mainland. And there is another result of Italian unity, a result in which we may rejoice without drawbacks, but which still has somewhat of sadness about it as finally ending that great phase of the history of Europe with which we have throughout been dealing. Never were ties with the past so fully snapped as when the army of Italy entered liberated Rome. Of all novelties in European history the greatest was when Rome became the centre of a dominion with acknowledged metes and bounds, the head in short of a local Italian kingdom. \"Rome the capital of Italy\" was a formula which might well gladden our hearts; but it was a formula which formally swept away the œcumenical position, the œcumenical traditions, of Rome&….\nBut the kingdom of Italy is not an appendage to Rome; Rome is the head of the kingdom. The whole is greater than its part; Rome, by her own free will and by the free will of Italy, has become less than Italy. By becoming the willing head of an Italian kingdom she has formally cast aside her Imperial traditions as they were not cast aside when brute force made her the head of a French department.\"\nBased on the historical context described by Edward A. Freeman, the author would likely take exception to the methods of Giuseppe Garibaldi during this time period in Italy.",

I have instanced Louis the XVI, who loved the trade of locksmith; an Infanta of Spain preferred that of shoemaker; a certain king of Denmark gratified himself by manufacturing syringes; the former king of Naples loved to sell the fish he had caught in the market-place himself; the prince of Parma, whom Condillac had trained in metaphysical subtitles, in the understanding of intuition, of cognition, had no taste but for the occupation of church-warden and lay-brother.\nThe great majority of wealthy children would follow these plebeian tastes, if civilized education did not oppose the development of them; and if the filthiness of the workshops and the coarseness of the workmen did not arouse a repugnance stronger than the attraction. What child of a prince is there who has no taste for one of the four occupations I have just mentioned, that of mason, carpenter, smith, saddler, and who would not advance in them if he beheld from an early age the work carried on in blight workshops, by refined people, who would always arrange a miniature workshop for children, with little implements and light labor?\nAccording to Charles Fourier's excerpt, he belongs to the group of intellectuals known as Utopian socialists.",

Placed beyond the passions which agitate society, it is in days of trial chiefly that they are called upon to despoil realities of their false appearances, and to show themselves as they are, fathers invested with the authority belonging by right to the heads of families, to prove that, in days of mourning, they know how to be just, wise, and therefore strong, and that they will not abandon the people whom they ought to govern to be the sport of factions, to error and its consequences, which must involve the loss of society.\nUnion between the monarchs is the basis of the policy which must now be followed to save society from total ruin. . . .\nLet them not confound concessions made to parties with the good they ought to do for their people, in modifying, according to their recognized needs, such branches of the administration as require it.\nLet them be just, but strong; beneficent, but strict.\nLet them maintain religious principles in all their purity, and not allow the faith to be attacked and morality interpreted according to the social contract or the visions of foolish sectarians.\nLet them suppress Secret Societies; that gangrene of society.\nBased on the text above the best description of the goals of the new ideology of conservatism as explained by Metternich is the suppression of nationalist and liberal revolutions that called for democratic and economic reforms.",

Those who have not witnessed it with their own eyes cannot imagine how great it is. Not a day passes but at least 200 people die of famine in the two provinces. We certify to having ourselves seen herds, not of cattle, but of men and women, wandering about the fields between Rheims and Rhétel, turning up the earth like pigs to find a few roots; and as they can only find rotten ones, and not half enough of them, they become so weak that they have not strength left to seek food. The parish priest at Boult, whose letter we enclose, tells us he has buried three of his parishioners who died of hunger. The rest subsisted on chopped straw mixed with earth, of which they composed a food which cannot be called bread. Other persons in the same place lived on the bodies of animals which had died of disease, and which the curé, otherwise unable to help his people, allowed them to roast at the presbytery fire.\n— The intellectual movement occurring in Europe at the time of the governmental report from the Estates of Normandy in 1651, which would help improve crop yields, is the Scientific Revolution.",

        "The following passage come from Erasmus and the Age of Reformation, written by Johan Huizinga, twentieth-century Dutch philosopher, 1924:\n\"In 1500 that work appeared which Erasmus had written after his misfortune at Dover, and had dedicated to Mountjoy, the Adagiorum Collectanea. It was a collection of about eight hundred proverbial sayings drawn from the Latin authors of antiquity and elucidated for the use of those who aspired to write an elegant Latin style. In the dedication Erasmus pointed out the profit an author may derive, both in ornamenting his style and in strengthening his argumentation, from having at his disposal a good supply of sentences hallowed by their antiquity. He proposes to offer such a help to his readers. What he actually gave was much more. He familiarized a much wider circle than the earlier humanists had reached with the spirit of antiquity.\nUntil this time the humanists had, to some extent, monopolized the treasures of classic culture, in order to parade their knowledge of which the multitude remained destitute, and so to become strange prodigies of learning and elegance. With his irresistible need of teaching and his sincere love for humanity and its general culture, Erasmus introduced the classic spirit, in so far as it could be reflected in the soul of a sixteenth-century Christian, among the people. Not he alone; but none more extensively and more effectively. Not among all the people, it is true, for by writing in Latin he limited his direct influence to the educated classes, which in those days were the upper classes.\nErasmus made current the classic spirit. Humanism ceased to be the exclusive privilege of a few. According to Beatus Rhenanus he had been reproached by some humanists, when about to publish the Adagia, for divulging the mysteries of their craft. But he desired that the book of antiquity should be open to all.\"\nBased on Huizinga's description of Erasmus's career, the contributions of Erasmus are most similar to those of Francesco Petrarch",

The one hurries on rapidly from the senses and particulars to the most general axioms, and from them, as principles and their supposed indisputable truth, derives and discovers the intermediate axioms. This is the way now in use. The other constructs its axioms from the senses and particulars, by ascending continually and gradually, till it finally arrives at the most general axioms, which is the true but unattempted way.\nXXII. Each of these two ways begins from the senses and particulars, and ends in the greatest generalities&…\nXXXVI.

Your Committee object to the words Household Suffrage since under any honest definition of the words—they would exclude a large majority of the men of these kingdoms—and because they have become reasonably obnoxious to the political portion of the working people.\nBased on the historical point of view in the document above, the author is not a radical reformer because he criticizes the Chartists.",

And as each machine will do as much work in twelve hours, as ten men can in that time do by hand, … [And, as the machines do] as much work in one day as would otherwise employ twenty men, … [a] full four thousand men are left to shift for a living how they can, and must of course fall to the Parish, if not timely relieved. … How are those men, thus thrown out of employ to provide for their families; and what are they to put their children apprentice to, that the rising generation may have something to keep them at work, in order that they may not be like vagabonds strolling about in idleness? … Many more evils we could enumerate, but we would hope, that the sensible part of mankind, who are not biased by interest, must see the dreadful tendency of their continuance; a depopulation must be the consequence; trade being then lost, the landed interest will have no other satisfaction but that of being last devoured.\nThe authors of the Leeds Woolen Workers Petition in 1786 made the assumption that the economic well-being of the city and region was tied to its inhabitants having employment.",

In fact, to divide power, and to give to one of the parties the exclusive right of judging of the portion allotted to each, is, in reality, not to divide it at all; and to reserve such exclusive right to the General Government (it matters not by what department to be exercised), is to convert it, in fact, into a great consolidated government, with unlimited powers, and to divest the States, in reality, of all their rights, It is impossible to understand the force of terms, and to deny so plain a conclusion.\"\n— The argument put forth by John C.

But the payment of duties laid by an act of Parliament as regulations of commerce was never disputed. . . . An external tax is a duty laid on commodities imported; that duty is added to the first cost and other charges on the commodity, and, when it is offered for sale, makes a part of the price. If the people do not like it at that price, they refuse it; they are not obliged to pay it. But an internal tax is forced from the people without their consent if not laid by their own representatives. The Stamp Act says we shall have no commerce, make no exchange of property with each other, neither purchase nor grant, nor recover debts; we shall neither marry nor make our wills, unless we pay such and such sums; and thus it is intended to extort our money from us or ruin us by the consequence of refusing to pay it.\"\nHelen Hunt Jackson in \"A Century of Dishonor\" was most critical of the policy described by Benjamin Franklin regarding taxation without representation.",

Women invested with the rights of citizens in one section—voters, jurors, office-holders—crossing an imaginary line, are subjects in the next. In some States, a married woman may hold property and transact business in her own name; in others, her earnings belong to her husband. In some States, a woman may testify against her husband, sue and be sued in the courts; in others, she has no redress in case of damage to person, property, or character. In case of divorce on account of adultery in the husband, the innocent wife is held to possess no right to children or property, unless by special decree of the court. But in no State of the Union has the wife the right to her own person, or to any part of the joint earnings of the co-partnership during the life of her husband. In some States women may enter the law schools and practice in the courts; in others they are forbidden.

The president of the bank has told us that most of the State banks exist by its forbearance.

Their power would be great whenever they might choose to exert it; but if this monopoly were regularly renewed every fifteen or twenty years on terms proposed by themselves, they might seldom in peace put forth their strength to influence elections or control the affairs of the nation.

When the fracture takes place at one end, if at the head of the thigh, the middle part of a thong wrapped round with wool, so that it may not cut the parts there, is to be applied to the perineum, and the ends of it brought up to the head and given to an assistant to hold, and applying a ligature below the fracture, we give the ends of it to another assistant to make extension. If it is fractured near the knee, we apply the ligature immediately above the fracture, and give the ends to an assistant, with which to make extension upwards; and while we put a ligature round the knee to secure it, and while the patient lies thus, with his leg extended, we arrange the fracture.\"\nPaul of Aegina, Epitome: On the Fracture of the Thigh and Nose, late seventh century C.E.\nSource 2:\n\"Medicine considers the human body as to the means by which it is cured and by which it is driven away from health.

If this tendency goes unchecked, the polarization in the countryside will inevitably be aggravated day by day. Those peasants who lose their land and those who remain in poverty will complain that we are doing nothing to save them from ruin or to help them overcome their difficulties.

Concerned that the bank might refuse prepayment, despite a rise in market interest rates in the year since the loan was made, or at least insist on the 5% prepayment fee, the man consulted an attorney concerning the enforceability of the above-quoted clause. There is no applicable statute. The attorney is likely to say that the two-year prepayment prohibition is unenforceable, but the prepayment fee provision is enforceable.",
        "A woman and a defendant entered into an arrangement where the woman promised to pay the defendant $10,000 to act as a surrogate mother. In return, the defendant agreed to be implanted with the woman's embryo and carry the baby to term. The woman paid the defendant the $10,000 upfront.

        "A rescuer was driving on an isolated portion of a country road. His headlights caught a figure lying at the side of the road. The rescuer stopped to investigate and found a victim, who was bleeding from head wounds and appeared to have been severely beaten. The rescuer then lifted the victim into his car and drove her to the hospital, a half-hour trip. When they arrived at the hospital, the rescuer carried the victim into the emergency room. He left her with a nurse and then returned home. Although the victim recovered from her injuries, she sued the hospital for malpractice, claiming that she was not promptly given medical attention. At trial, the nurse proposes to testify that when the victim was first brought to the hospital, she was unconscious. The victim's attorney objects and moves to strike the nurse's testimony. The trial judge should overrule the objection, because it is a shorthand rendition of what she observed.",
        "A young woman who attended a rock concert at a nightclub was injured when the band opened its performance with illegal fireworks that ignited foam insulation in the club's ceiling and walls. The young woman sued the radio station that sponsored the performance. The radio station has moved for summary judgment, claiming that it owed no duty to audience members. The evidence has established the following facts: The station advertised its sponsorship on the radio and in print, distributed free tickets to the concert, and in print, distributed free tickets to the concert, staffed the event with the station's interns to assist with crowd control, and provided a station disc jockey to serve as master of ceremonies. The master of ceremonies had the authority to stop or delay the performance at any time on the basis of any safety concern. The station knew or should have known that the band routinely used unlicensed, illegal fireworks in its performances. The court should not grant the radio station's motion for summary judgment, because there is sufficient evidence of knowledge and control on the part of the station to impose on it a duty of care to audience members.",

        "In 1960, a widower, advancing into old age, realizes that he is no longer able to farm his 1,000 acres; therefore, he decides to sell some of the farmland in parcels of 250 acres. The president of a development company is interested in purchasing three of the parcels. The president buys the three parcels from the widower and begins formulating plans for constructing single-family dwelling units on the land, which is located in an upper-middle-class area of the county. The original deed between the widower and the development company contains a provision expressly binding \"upon all subsequent grantees, their heirs, and assigns,\" stipulating that any further subdivisions by any such persons shall be restricted to minimum two-acre lots to be used for single-family dwelling units only. In the original deed between the widower and the development company, the stipulation that restricted the size and residential character of any subsequent subdivision of the parcels is an example of a negative covenant.",
        "A registered pharmacist was falsely told by his best friend one day that the friend needed a dangerous drug for an experiment he was conducting with rats in his lab. Unbeknownst to the pharmacist, his friend used the drug to poison his girlfriend. The poison killed her. The pharmacist was aware that his best friend had a volatile relationship with his girlfriend. A statute in the jurisdiction provides: \"Any intentional and premeditated killing or one occurring during the perpetration of a felony, is murder in the first degree. Murder in the second degree is murder with intent to cause serious bodily harm. Manslaughter is an unlawful killing due to recklessness. \" Assault with intent to kill or to cause serious physical injury is a felony in the jurisdiction. There are no separate felonies relating to adulterating food or poisoning. Finally, it is a misdemeanor in the jurisdiction to distribute drugs without a prescription. The most serious crime for which the pharmacist can properly be convicted is selling drugs without a prescription.",

        "A man and a woman conspired to rob a local bank. After entering the bank, they pulled out guns and ordered everyone to the floor. They demanded money from the tellers but, unknown to them, one of the tellers activated a silent alarm. Within minutes, the bank was surrounded by police officers. A standoff ensued for several hours with the man and the woman barricaded inside the bank with several hostages. The man decided to try and make a getaway. He took the bank manager and, using her as a human shield, exited the bank. A shooting ensued, and both the man and the bank manager were killed by the police. This jurisdiction follows the agency theory of felony murder. The woman is charged with felony murder for the deaths of the man and the bank manager. The woman's attorney has filed a motion to dismiss both charges. The court should grant the motion regarding the man's death, but deny the motion regarding the death of the bank manager.",
        "During the murder trial of a defendant, the prosecution presented four witnesses to the brutal slaying of the victim. The evidence pointed to the fact that the defendant beat her about the head and neck with a baseball bat, causing severe injuries to her brain and her ultimate death. The prosecution rested, and the defendant presented two witnesses, his brother and his girlfriend, who testified that the defendant was dining at an elegant restaurant on the other side of town at the time of the alleged murder. The defendant presented no other witnesses. During his closing argument to the jury, the assistant district attorney called attention to the fact that the prosecution witnesses had no apparent reason to have any bias toward the prosecution or against the defendant. He then noted that the defendant's witnesses had clear motives to falsify their testimony and favor the defendant. The assistant district attorney added, \"If the defendant was on the other side of town, why didn't he tell us himself? Why didn't he get on the stand? What was he hiding? Those are questions for you, the jury, to answer. \"The defendant was convicted of first-degree murder and sentenced to life imprisonment. On appeal, his conviction should be reversed, because the assistant district attorney's argument violated the defendant's rights under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments.",
        "A pedestrian was walking in front of a hotel in the downtown area when a chair was thrown from an unidentified window. The chair struck the pedestrian on the head, knocking her unconscious. When the pedestrian recovered consciousness, she found herself in a nearby hospital with a doctor in attendance. An examination revealed that the pedestrian had suffered a concussion and severe head lacerations. A subsequent investigation revealed that the chair had, in fact, been thrown from a window at the hotel. None of the hotel's employees or guests, however, admitted culpability for the incident. If the pedestrian asserts a claim against the hotel for negligence, the doctrine of res ipsa loquitur will not enable her to recover because the chair was not within the control of the hotel at the time the pedestrian was injured.",
        "A collector had an extensive collection of sports memorabilia, which included baseball cards, autographed bats, balls, and old uniforms. The collector would often attend regional shows where he would display his vast collection and meet with other sports enthusiasts. One day at a sports memorabilia show, the defendant approached the collector with an old baseball glove with what appeared to be an authentic signature of a famous player. Unknown to the collector, the defendant signed the glove himself. The defendant had practiced the distinctive signature of the famous player for several hours before signing the glove with an extremely good likeness of his signature. The collector examined the glove and asked the defendant if the signature was authentic. The defendant replied that he had purchased the glove at an auction and could not vouch for the authenticity of the signature. The collector paid the defendant for the glove. Later, the collector took the glove to a handwriting expert who informed the collector that the signature on the glove was a very skillful fake, but a fake, nonetheless. The defendant is guilty of false pretenses and forgery."
